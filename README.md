# Google Maps JavaScript API

This project is for testing purpose only.

## Google map with a React app

In this project the **vis.gl/react-google-map** library for Google Maps Platform is used.

This app:
- Loads free fake JSON data from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users
- Loads a map in a React app.
- Uses markers, custom markers according to loaded data.
- Searchers for places/names/phones/...etc
- Dynamicly changes the list of addresses when a user moves the map, or changes the map scale
